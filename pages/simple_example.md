\page simple_example A simple code example for encoding codons one-by-one

This code sample is a demonstration of a program which will take DNA or mRNA codes via standard input, attempt to encode codons into single-letter animo acid codes, then print the amino acid codes to standard output:

\include[lineno] codon_encoder.c
